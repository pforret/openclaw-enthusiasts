It watches <code>~/.openclaw/openclaw.json</code> and hot-reloads changes automatically. Node A companion device app (iOS, Android, macOS) that pairs with the Gateway via WebSocket and exposes device-local capabilities. Nodes let agents access things like camera snapshots, screen content, location, or shell execution on remote hosts. Instance A running deployment of the OpenClaw system. When you run <code>openclaw gateway</code>, you start one instance -- a single process handling all WebSocket connections from channel adapters, CLI tools, the web UI, and companion nodes."},{"location":"explain/terminology/#core-concepts","title":"Core Concepts","text":"Agent An AI assistant powered by the Agent Core runtime. Each agent has its own workspace, model configuration, tool policies, and authentication profiles. Agents process incoming messages, assemble system prompts, call LLM providers, execute tools, and can escalate to humans when needed. You can run multiple isolated agents on a single instance. Skill A self-contained bundle of prompts and metadata that extends an agent's capabilities. Skills live in the agent's <code>workspace/skills/</code> directory and are automatically discovered and injected into system prompts. They're installed from ClawHub. Examples: Google Calendar, Home Assistant, Stripe, PDF 2, Exa Web Search. Session The unit of conversation state. Each session is identified by a unique key encoding the agent ID, channel, chat type, and peer. Sessions maintain message history, model settings, and tool execution state. Transcripts are persisted as JSONL files in <code>~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/</code>. Session scoping can be per-channel, per-peer, or per-account. Channel A messaging platform adapter that normalizes platform-specific protocols into a unified message format. Each channel handles authentication and access control policies (pairing, allowlist, open, or disabled). Supported channels: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, Email, SMS. Cron The scheduled task automation system built into the Gateway. Lets agents execute actions at specified times or intervals using standard cron syntax. Example: <code>0 7 * * * openclaw run morning-briefing</code> runs a briefing agent daily at 7 AM. Managed by the CronManager component with settings for max concurrent runs and session retention. SOUL.md The Markdown instruction file that defines an agent's behavior, personality, rules, and decision logic. This is where you tell the agent what to do and how to do it. ClawHub The marketplace where OpenClaw skills are published, discovered, and installed from. ClawFlow OpenClaw's workflow orchestration system for chaining multiple skills and services into multi-step automations.
